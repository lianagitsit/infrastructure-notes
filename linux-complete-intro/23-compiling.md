`make` utility to maintain programs

## Compiling

Compiling is the process of translating source code into the native language of the computer's processor (machine language)

Not all programs are compiled. Scripting or interpreted languages, such as Perl, Python, PHP, and Ruby, are executed by a program called an interpreter. The interpreter inputs the program file and reads and executes each instruction contained within it. In general, interpreted programs execute much more slowly than compiled programs because each source code instruction is transalted every time it is carried out, whereas compiled programs are translated once and the translation is permanently recorded in the final executable file.

But interpreted languages are popular because they eliminate compile time in development, making development faster.

# Navigation

To navigate the file structure in the command line, imagine you are in the middle of a maze shaped like an upside down tree.

At any given time, you are standing in a directory. You can see the files in the directory you're standing in, and you can see the path to the directory above you (the parent directory) and any directories below you (subdirectories).

The directory you're standing in is called the current working directory, and you can see the path there with the command `pwd` (print working directory).
